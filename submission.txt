my program works correctly, and I insist on using (row,col) indexing notation 
in my results.

My program computes largest pool in O(n), I used a modified version of my own
 largest area in histogram algorithm I developed while training with old ACM 
 questions. The similar problem also comes up in TopCoder div2 bracket.
I don't think that the lecturer is expecting his students to deliver ACM level
solution but apparently this is the only O(n) I can come up with. Maybe there 
was some crucial information for reduction that I have missed.
